              If your SR-22 insurance lapses in Kansas, your insurance provider is required to notify the DMV, which could result in the suspension of your driver's license. Additionally, you may face an extension of your SR-22 requirement or additional fines. To avoid these consequences, it's crucial to maintain continuous SR-22 coverage throughout the mandated period.

             Yes, you can switch insurance providers while maintaining your SR-22 requirement in Kansas. Before switching, ensure your new provider is aware of your SR-22 requirement and can file the necessary documentation with the DMV. It's important to avoid any coverage gaps during the transition to prevent license suspension or other penalties.
